# HuntTheWumpus
## Project Description
Hunt the Wumpus is a game where players aim to kill the Wumpus, collect gold, and escape. You can move in four directions and fire up to three arrows. Arrows can travel a maximum of three squares, eliminating the Wumpus if it's within range. The gold is randomly placed. Beware of two pits and two bats - falling into pits results in a loss, and bats reverse your movement for five turns. Walking into the Wumpus room leads to instant death. The Wumpus has a 75% chance of moving if you miss a shot. Percepts at the start of each new round inform you about adjacent hazards. There are two modes you can run, debug and normal. Debug allows you to see all of the items and hazards while normal only shows your current location. To escape you must return to your original coordinates.
